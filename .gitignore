# Streamlit specific
# --------------------
.streamlit/
# If you are saving uploaded files temporarily, these should ideally be in a temp dir
# that's outside the git repo or explicitly cleaned up.
# However, if you have a specific folder for temporary uploads *within* your project, ignore it:
# uploads/
# temp_files/
# temp_data/

# Data and Results
# -----------------
# Ignore any dynamically generated data files, processed outputs, or sensitive data

*.txt # Be careful with this - only if you generate text files you don't want to track
# Example: specific log files or analysis reports you don't want in Git
# my_app_logs.log
# analysis_report.pdf

# Environment variables and sensitive files
# ------------------------------------------
.env # Common for storing API keys, secrets etc.
*.env # Catch all .env files
*.ini # For config files that might contain sensitive info
*.cfg # For config files that might contain sensitive info
.streamlit/secrets.toml # Streamlit's way to manage secrets locally. VERY IMPORTANT TO IGNORE!
secrets.toml # In case you put it directly in root (less common)
