## About Gradewise Planner

Gradewise Planner is an intelligent Streamlit application designed to streamline two critical aspects of academic management for educators: **student assignment evaluation** and **syllabus planning**. This tool aims to enhance efficiency, consistency, and provide insightful analysis, moving beyond manual processes.

Whether you need to generate detailed, rubric-based grades for student submissions or create a structured syllabus from key topics and weekly schedules, Gradewise Planner provides the tools to simplify your academic workflow.

**Key Problems it Solves:**
* **Time-consuming manual grading:** Automates the assessment process with clear, data-driven analysis.
* **Inconsistent feedback:** Ensures standardized evaluation based on predefined rubrics.
* **Tedious syllabus creation:** Generates comprehensive course outlines quickly from raw inputs.
* **Lack of insight:** Provides analytical breakdowns of student performance and course structure.

## Features

### **1. Intelligent Assignment Evaluation & Grading**
* **Rubric-Based Grading:** [Briefly describe how users define/upload rubrics and how the evaluation uses them. e.g., "Allows users to define custom rubrics with criteria and scoring."]
* **Detailed Analysis:** [Explain what kind of analysis is provided. e.g., "Provides comprehensive analysis of student submissions, highlighting strengths and weaknesses against rubric criteria."]
* **Automated Feedback Generation:** [If applicable, mention if it generates human-readable feedback. e.g., "Generates actionable feedback comments based on evaluation results."]
* **[Future addition, e.g., Plagiarism detection integration, Grade export options, etc.]**

### **2. Dynamic Syllabus & Curriculum Planning**
* **Subject-Centric Planning:** [Describe how users input subjects or course titles.]
* **Key Topic Integration:** [Explain how users define key topics or learning objectives.]
* **Week-by-Week Scheduling:** [Detail how the app helps structure content over weeks. e.g., "Intuitively maps topics to weekly schedules, allowing for flexible adjustments."]
* **Auto-Generated Syllabi:** [Explain the output format. e.g., "Generates well-formatted syllabi ready for distribution."]
* **[Future addition, e.g., Resource linking, Learning outcome alignment, Pre-requisite tracking, etc.]**

## How It Works

Gradewise Planner leverages the power of Python and Streamlit to provide an interactive web interface.

1.  **Input Collection:** Users interact with forms to input assignment details, rubrics, syllabus topics, and weekly structures.
2.  **Processing Engine:**
    * **For Grading:** [Briefly describe the backend logic. e.g., "Utilizes [mention specific libraries/logic, e.g., NLP for text analysis, data processing for rubric matching] to process student submissions and apply rubric rules."]
    * **For Planning:** [Briefly describe the backend logic. e.g., "Employs [mention specific libraries/logic] to organize and structure course content based on user-defined parameters."]
3.  **Output & Visualization:** Results are presented directly within the Streamlit app, utilizing interactive tables (`st.dataframe`), charts, and structured text (`st.expander`, `st.tabs`) for a clear and organized display.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get Gradewise Planner up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Python 3.8+** (or your specific Python version)
* **pip** (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[YOUR_USERNAME]/gradewise-planner.git
    cd gradewise-planner
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    * **Note:** You will need to create a `requirements.txt` file in your project's root directory containing all the Python libraries your app uses (e.g., `streamlit`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `spacy`, `nltk`, `openai`, etc.). You can generate it using `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing your dependencies.

### Running the Application

1.  **Ensure your virtual environment is active.**
2.  **Run the Streamlit app:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    (Replace `app.py` with the name of your main Streamlit script, e.g., `main_app.py` if you used `streamlit_app.py` and `pages/` structure, then it would be `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`)

    The application will open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Usage

1.  **Navigate to the app in your browser.**
2.  **Select the desired functionality from the sidebar/tabs** (e.g., "Assignment Grader" or "Syllabus Planner").
3.  **Follow the on-screen instructions** to input your data (e.g., upload student submissions, paste rubric text, enter subject details, define weekly topics).
4.  **Click the "Evaluate" or "Generate" button** to process your inputs.
5.  **View the detailed analysis or generated syllabus** directly on the page, using interactive elements like expanders and tabs for a comprehensive experience.

[**TODO:** Add screenshots or GIFs demonstrating key usage flows here]
